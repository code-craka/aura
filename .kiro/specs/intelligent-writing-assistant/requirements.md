# Intelligent Writing Assistant - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Intelligent Writing Assistant transforms content creation by providing AI-powered writing support that learns individual writing styles, incorporates research from browsing context, and assists with various content formats. This system serves as a comprehensive writing companion that enhances creativity, improves quality, and accelerates content production while maintaining the user's authentic voice.

The system integrates deeply with cross-tab intelligence to incorporate research seamlessly, learns from user writing patterns to provide personalized assistance, and supports multiple content formats from emails to long-form articles. It operates as both a proactive writing coach and an on-demand content generation tool.

## Foundation Dependencies

This system builds upon the following foundational components:

- **Browser Core Foundation**: Provides content extraction, browser integration, and cross-platform compatibility
- **AI Engine Foundation**: Supplies style learning models, content generation, fact-checking, and privacy protection
- **UI Foundation**: Delivers writing interface components, real-time suggestion displays, and collaborative editing tools
- **Cross-Tab Intelligence**: Provides research context and multi-source information synthesis

These foundations must be implemented before the Intelligent Writing Assistant can be developed.

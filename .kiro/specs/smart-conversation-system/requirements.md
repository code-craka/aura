# Smart Conversation System - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Smart Conversation System is the foundational AI interface for Project Aura, providing users with a natural language gateway to interact with the browser's AI capabilities. This system transforms the traditional browser experience by enabling contextual, multi-turn conversations that understand the user's current browsing context and provide intelligent assistance across all browser functions.

The system serves as the primary interaction layer between users and AI, supporting everything from simple queries to complex multi-step workflows, while maintaining conversation context and learning from user preferences.

## Foundation Dependencies

This system builds upon the following foundational components:

- **Browser Core Foundation**: Provides AI integration hooks, content extraction APIs, and browser action automation
- **AI Engine Foundation**: Supplies multi-model AI integration, context management, and privacy-safe processing
- **UI Foundation**: Delivers React components, design system, and AI-enhanced UI patterns

These foundations must be implemented before the Smart Conversation System can be developed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Natural Language Interface

**User Story:** As a browser user, I want to communicate with my browser using natural language so that I can get help and perform tasks without learning complex commands or interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a natural language query THEN the system SHALL parse the intent and provide a relevant response within 3 seconds
2. WHEN a user asks follow-up questions THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context from previous exchanges
3. WHEN a user uses colloquial language or typos THEN the system SHALL understand the intent and respond appropriately
4. WHEN a user switches topics THEN the system SHALL gracefully transition while maintaining relevant context
5. IF a user's query is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions before proceeding

### Requirement 2: Multi-Modal AI Integration

**User Story:** As a power user, I want the conversation system to leverage multiple AI models so that I get the best possible responses regardless of query complexity or type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives a query THEN it SHALL use the AI Engine Foundation's router to select the most appropriate AI model (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) based on query type
2. WHEN the primary model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL leverage AI Engine Foundation's fallback mechanisms without user interruption
3. WHEN a model fails to respond THEN the system SHALL use AI Engine Foundation's error handling to retry with different models and inform users of limitations
4. WHEN processing complex queries THEN the system SHALL utilize AI Engine Foundation's response aggregation to combine multiple model outputs
5. IF all models are unavailable THEN the system SHALL use AI Engine Foundation's local processing capabilities for offline functionality

### Requirement 3: Contextual Awareness

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the AI to understand what I'm currently viewing and working on so that its responses are relevant to my current context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question THEN the system SHALL use Browser Core Foundation's content extraction APIs to access tab content and AI Engine Foundation's context management for response formulation
2. WHEN referencing information THEN the system SHALL use AI Engine Foundation's source tracking to cite specific sources from the user's browsing context
3. WHEN the user has multiple tabs open THEN the system SHALL leverage AI Engine Foundation's context relevance scoring to identify the most relevant tabs for the current query
4. WHEN providing suggestions THEN the system SHALL use Browser Core Foundation's state monitoring and AI Engine Foundation's context analysis for pattern-based recommendations
5. IF sensitive content is detected THEN the system SHALL use AI Engine Foundation's privacy framework to request permission before including content in analysis

### Requirement 4: Conversation Memory and Learning

**User Story:** As a frequent user, I want the conversation system to remember our previous interactions and learn my preferences so that responses become more personalized over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user returns to a previous conversation THEN the system SHALL recall the full conversation history
2. WHEN a user expresses preferences THEN the system SHALL remember and apply them to future interactions
3. WHEN a user corrects the AI THEN the system SHALL learn from the correction and improve future responses
4. WHEN patterns emerge in user behavior THEN the system SHALL proactively adapt its communication style
5. IF a user requests privacy mode THEN the system SHALL not store conversation history or learn from that session

### Requirement 5: Voice and Text Input Support

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want to interact with the conversation system through both voice and text so that I can use the method most comfortable for my situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the voice input button THEN the system SHALL activate speech recognition and provide visual feedback
2. WHEN voice input is detected THEN the system SHALL convert speech to text with >95% accuracy for clear speech
3. WHEN the user prefers voice output THEN the system SHALL provide spoken responses using natural-sounding text-to-speech
4. WHEN background noise interferes THEN the system SHALL request the user to repeat or switch to text input
5. IF voice features are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to text-only mode

### Requirement 6: Response Quality and Citations

**User Story:** As a professional user, I want AI responses to be accurate, well-sourced, and transparent about their reasoning so that I can trust and verify the information provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing factual information THEN the system SHALL include citations to source materials when available
2. WHEN making recommendations THEN the system SHALL explain the reasoning behind suggestions
3. WHEN uncertainty exists THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate confidence levels and limitations
4. WHEN referencing user's tabs THEN the system SHALL highlight specific sections or quotes that informed the response
5. IF information cannot be verified THEN the system SHALL clearly mark it as unverified or speculative

### Requirement 7: Integration with Browser Functions

**User Story:** As a productivity user, I want the conversation system to help me perform browser actions so that I can accomplish tasks through natural language commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests navigation THEN the system SHALL use Browser Core Foundation's navigation APIs to open URLs or search for content as requested
2. WHEN a user wants to manage tabs THEN the system SHALL use Browser Core Foundation's Tab Management System to create, close, or organize tabs based on natural language instructions
3. WHEN a user needs bookmarks THEN the system SHALL use Browser Core Foundation's bookmark APIs to save, organize, or retrieve bookmarks through conversation
4. WHEN a user requests browser settings changes THEN the system SHALL use Browser Core Foundation's configuration system to guide users or make approved changes
5. IF an action requires confirmation THEN the system SHALL use Browser Core Foundation's security framework to explain actions and request explicit approval

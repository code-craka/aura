# Cross-Tab Intelligence - Requirements Document

## Introduction

Cross-Tab Intelligence is a core AI capability that analyzes and synthesizes information across multiple open browser tabs, transforming fragmented web browsing into coherent, actionable insights. This system enables users to understand relationships between different sources, compare information across tabs, and receive synthesized answers that draw from their entire browsing context.

The system operates continuously in the background, building a semantic understanding of open content while respecting user privacy. It serves as the foundation for advanced features like research automation, content creation assistance, and proactive task suggestions.

## Foundation Dependencies

This system builds upon the following foundational components:

- **Browser Core Foundation**: Provides tab management, content extraction APIs, and cross-tab communication
- **AI Engine Foundation**: Supplies context management, vector storage, privacy filtering, and multi-source analysis
- **UI Foundation**: Delivers components for displaying cross-tab insights and source citations

These foundations must be implemented before Cross-Tab Intelligence can be developed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-Time Content Analysis

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the system to automatically analyze content from all my open tabs so that I can ask questions that span multiple sources without manually referencing each tab.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens a new tab with content THEN the system SHALL use Browser Core Foundation's content extraction APIs and AI Engine Foundation's context processing to extract and analyze content within 5 seconds
2. WHEN tab content changes or updates THEN the system SHALL use Browser Core Foundation's change monitoring and AI Engine Foundation's real-time context updates to re-analyze content
3. WHEN a user has 20+ tabs open THEN the system SHALL use Browser Core Foundation's efficient tab management and AI Engine Foundation's performance optimization to maintain analysis without degrading browser responsiveness
4. WHEN content is extracted THEN the system SHALL use AI Engine Foundation's content analysis to identify key topics, entities, and concepts automatically
5. IF a tab contains sensitive information THEN the system SHALL use AI Engine Foundation's privacy framework to request permission before including content in analysis

_Foundation Dependencies: Browser Core Foundation (Content Extraction APIs, Change Monitoring, Tab Management), AI Engine Foundation (Context Processing, Privacy Framework, Performance Optimization)_

### Requirement 2: Multi-Source Information Synthesis

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want to ask questions that require information from multiple tabs and receive synthesized answers so that I can quickly understand complex topics without manually cross-referencing sources.

3. WHEN providing synthesized answers THEN the system SHALL cite specific tabs and sections that contributed to the response
4. WHEN information conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL present different perspectives with clear source attribution
5. IF synthesis requires more than 10 seconds THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates and partial results

### Requirement 3: Semantic Relationship Detection

**User Story:** As a professional researcher, I want the system to identify relationships and connections between information across my tabs so that I can discover insights I might have missed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing multiple tabs THEN the system SHALL identify semantic relationships between concepts and entities
2. WHEN related information is found THEN the system SHALL group and categorize related content automatically
3. WHEN contradictory information exists THEN the system SHALL flag discrepancies and highlight the differences
4. WHEN temporal relationships exist THEN the system SHALL identify chronological connections and sequences
5. IF relationship confidence is low THEN the system SHALL indicate uncertainty and request user validation

### Requirement 4: Content Comparison and Analysis

**User Story:** As a decision-maker, I want to compare information across multiple tabs to understand differences, similarities, and make informed choices based on comprehensive analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing similar content across tabs THEN the system SHALL create structured comparisons highlighting key differences
2. WHEN analyzing competing options THEN the system SHALL extract pros, cons, and key differentiators
3. WHEN numerical data is present THEN the system SHALL perform quantitative comparisons and identify trends
4. WHEN evaluating sources THEN the system SHALL assess credibility and provide source quality indicators
5. IF comparison requires specific criteria THEN the system SHALL allow users to specify comparison parameters

### Requirement 5: Context-Aware Query Processing

**User Story:** As a busy professional, I want my questions to be understood in the context of what I'm currently viewing so that I get relevant answers without having to explain my entire situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question THEN the system SHALL consider the active tab as primary context
2. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL weight information based on recency and user attention patterns
3. WHEN ambiguous queries are received THEN the system SHALL use tab context to disambiguate and provide relevant responses
4. WHEN follow-up questions are asked THEN the system SHALL maintain context from previous queries and current tab state
5. IF context is insufficient THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions while suggesting relevant tabs

### Requirement 6: Privacy-Safe Content Processing

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want control over which tabs are analyzed and how my browsing data is processed so that I maintain privacy while benefiting from cross-tab intelligence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects potentially sensitive content THEN it SHALL request explicit permission before processing
2. WHEN users enable private browsing mode THEN the system SHALL not analyze or store any tab content
3. WHEN processing content THEN the system SHALL anonymize personal information unless explicitly permitted
4. WHEN storing analysis results THEN the system SHALL encrypt all data and provide user control over retention
5. IF users revoke permissions THEN the system SHALL immediately stop processing and delete related data

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a power user with many tabs, I want the cross-tab analysis to work efficiently without slowing down my browser or consuming excessive resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing content THEN the system SHALL use less than 500MB additional memory for up to 50 tabs
2. WHEN processing large documents THEN the system SHALL use incremental analysis to maintain responsiveness
3. WHEN the browser is under heavy load THEN the system SHALL throttle analysis to preserve user experience
4. WHEN network bandwidth is limited THEN the system SHALL prioritize local processing over cloud analysis
5. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL gracefully reduce analysis depth while maintaining core functionality

### Requirement 8: Source Attribution and Transparency

**User Story:** As an academic researcher, I want clear attribution and transparency about how information was analyzed so that I can verify sources and understand the basis for synthesized insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

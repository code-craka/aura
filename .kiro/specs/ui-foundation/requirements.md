# UI Foundation - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The UI Foundation provides the core user interface framework for Project Aura, built on React and TypeScript with a custom design system. This foundation enables the creation of consistent, accessible, and performant user interfaces while supporting the unique AI-native features that differentiate Project Aura.

This system must provide a solid foundation for all UI components while maintaining flexibility for AI-enhanced interactions and progressive disclosure of advanced features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: React Component Architecture

**User Story:** As a UI developer, I need a robust React component system so that I can build consistent and reusable interface elements efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating components THEN they SHALL follow consistent TypeScript interfaces and patterns
2. WHEN building UI THEN components SHALL be fully accessible with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
3. WHEN rendering THEN components SHALL support both light and dark themes seamlessly
4. WHEN testing THEN all components SHALL have comprehensive unit and integration tests
5. IF components change THEN they SHALL maintain backward compatibility through versioned APIs

### Requirement 2: Design System Implementation

**User Story:** As a designer and developer, I want a comprehensive design system so that all UI elements are consistent and follow established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN styling components THEN they SHALL use the standardized color palette and typography
2. WHEN spacing elements THEN they SHALL follow the consistent spacing system
3. WHEN creating interactions THEN they SHALL use standardized animation and transition patterns
4. WHEN building layouts THEN they SHALL use the responsive grid system and breakpoints
5. IF design tokens change THEN they SHALL propagate automatically to all components

### Requirement 3: AI-Enhanced UI Components

**User Story:** As a user, I want UI components that intelligently adapt and enhance based on AI insights so that my interface becomes more helpful over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI provides suggestions THEN UI components SHALL display them contextually and non-intrusively
2. WHEN AI is processing THEN components SHALL show appropriate loading states and progress indicators
3. WHEN AI enhances functionality THEN components SHALL provide clear explanations of AI actions
4. WHEN users interact with AI features THEN components SHALL provide immediate feedback and confirmation
5. IF AI features are unavailable THEN components SHALL gracefully degrade to standard functionality#
## Requirement 4: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be fast and responsive so that my interactions feel immediate and smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interacting with UI THEN response time SHALL be <100ms for 95% of interactions
2. WHEN rendering components THEN initial paint SHALL occur within 200ms
3. WHEN animating THEN all animations SHALL maintain 60fps performance
4. WHEN loading data THEN UI SHALL remain responsive with appropriate loading states
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize rendering and interactions

### Requirement 5: Accessibility and Internationalization

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want full access to all features so that I can use the browser effectively regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN all components SHALL provide proper ARIA labels and descriptions
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible and properly focused
3. WHEN using high contrast mode THEN all components SHALL maintain readability and functionality
4. WHEN changing languages THEN all UI text SHALL be properly localized and formatted
5. IF accessibility features are needed THEN they SHALL be available without requiring special configuration

### Requirement 6: Responsive Design System

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the interface to adapt appropriately so that I have an optimal experience on any screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using mobile devices THEN UI SHALL adapt to touch interactions and smaller screens
2. WHEN using tablets THEN UI SHALL optimize for both touch and precision interactions
3. WHEN using desktop THEN UI SHALL take advantage of larger screens and precise input methods
4. WHEN resizing windows THEN UI SHALL adapt fluidly without breaking layouts
5. IF screen orientation changes THEN UI SHALL reflow appropriately and maintain functionality

### Requirement 7: Theme and Customization System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize the appearance of my browser so that it matches my preferences and working environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching themes THEN all components SHALL update immediately without requiring restarts
2. WHEN customizing colors THEN changes SHALL apply consistently across all interface elements
3. WHEN adjusting density THEN UI SHALL provide compact, normal, and spacious layout options
4. WHEN setting preferences THEN customizations SHALL persist across browser sessions
5. IF themes conflict THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution options and fallbacks

### Requirement 8: Component Testing and Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I need comprehensive testing tools so that I can ensure UI components work correctly and maintain quality over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing components THEN they SHALL have automated visual regression testing
2. WHEN testing interactions THEN all user flows SHALL be covered by integration tests
3. WHEN checking accessibility THEN automated tools SHALL validate WCAG compliance
4. WHEN measuring performance THEN components SHALL meet established benchmarks
5. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and debugging information

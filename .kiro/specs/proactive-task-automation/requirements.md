# Proactive Task Automation - Requirements Document

## Introduction

Proactive Task Automation transforms the browser from a reactive tool into an intelligent assistant that anticipates user needs and suggests contextually relevant actions. This system continuously analyzes user behavior patterns, browsing context, and available data to proactively suggest automations, shortcuts, and optimizations that enhance productivity without being intrusive.

The system learns from user interactions, adapts to changing workflows, and provides timely suggestions that feel helpful rather than disruptive. It serves as the intelligence layer that makes Project Aura truly agentic by anticipating needs before users explicitly request assistance.

## Foundation Dependencies

This system builds upon the following foundational components:

- **Browser Core Foundation**: Provides behavior monitoring, action APIs, and user interaction tracking
- **AI Engine Foundation**: Supplies pattern recognition, predictive modeling, and context analysis
- **UI Foundation**: Delivers suggestion interfaces, notification components, and user feedback systems
- **Cross-Tab Intelligence**: Provides cross-context analysis and workflow pattern detection
- **Custom Command System**: Supplies automation execution and workflow management capabilities

These foundations must be implemented before Proactive Task Automation can be developed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Behavioral Pattern Recognition

**User Story:** As a busy professional, I want the browser to learn my work patterns so that it can anticipate my needs and suggest helpful actions before I have to think about them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs similar actions repeatedly THEN the system SHALL use Browser Core Foundation's behavior monitoring and AI Engine Foundation's pattern recognition to identify patterns and suggest automation opportunities
2. WHEN user behavior changes over time THEN the system SHALL use AI Engine Foundation's adaptive learning to update understanding and suggestion algorithms
3. WHEN patterns involve multiple tabs or applications THEN the system SHALL use Cross-Tab Intelligence and Browser Core Foundation's cross-context tracking to recognize workflows and dependencies
4. WHEN temporal patterns exist THEN the system SHALL use AI Engine Foundation's predictive modeling to identify time-based triggers and suggest scheduled automations
5. IF pattern confidence is low THEN the system SHALL use AI Engine Foundation's confidence scoring to continue learning without making suggestions until confidence threshold is reached

_Foundation Dependencies: Browser Core Foundation (Behavior Monitoring, Cross-context Tracking), AI Engine Foundation (Pattern Recognition, Adaptive Learning, Predictive Modeling, Confidence Scoring), Cross-Tab Intelligence (Workflow Detection)_

1. WHEN emails or web pages contain event information THEN the system SHALL extract dates, times, and details for calendar creation
2. WHEN scheduling conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative times or highlight conflicts
3. WHEN recurring patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL suggest creating recurring calendar events

5. IF calendar integration requires permissions THEN the system SHALL request access with clear explanations of benefits

### Requirement 6: Content and Research Assistance

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the system to proactively suggest related content, sources, and research directions based on what I'm currently reading or working on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing content THEN the system SHALL identify related topics and suggest additional sources or perspectives
2. WHEN research patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest systematic approaches and organization methods
3. WHEN contradictory information is found THEN the system SHALL proactively highlight discrepancies and suggest verification

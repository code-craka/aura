# Proactive Task Automation - Design Document

## Overview

Proactive Task Automation serves as the intelligent anticipation layer of Project Aura, continuously analyzing user behavior, context, and patterns to provide timely, relevant suggestions that enhance productivity without being intrusive. The system operates as a background intelligence service that learns, adapts, and proactively assists users in their daily workflows.

The design emphasizes privacy-first learning, contextual relevance, and intelligent timing to ensure suggestions feel helpful rather than disruptive. The system integrates deeply with other Aura components to provide comprehensive automation opportunities across all browser activities.

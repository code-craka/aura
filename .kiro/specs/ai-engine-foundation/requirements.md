# AI Engine Foundation - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Engine Foundation provides the core infrastructure for all AI capabilities in Project Aura. This system manages multiple AI model providers, handles context extraction and processing, ensures privacy and security, and provides a unified interface for all AI features to build upon.

This foundation must be robust, scalable, and secure while providing seamless integration with the browser core and enabling the advanced AI features that differentiate Project Aura.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Model AI Integration

**User Story:** As an AI feature developer, I need a unified interface to multiple AI models so that I can build features that leverage the best model for each task without managing provider-specific implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating AI models THEN the system SHALL support GPT-4, Claude-3, and Gemini Pro with unified APIs
2. WHEN a model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to alternative models
3. WHEN routing queries THEN the system SHALL select the optimal model based on query type and complexity
4. WHEN managing costs THEN the system SHALL track usage and optimize for cost-effectiveness
5. IF new models are added THEN the system SHALL support them through standardized provider interfaces

### Requirement 2: Context Management System

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI features to understand my browsing context so that responses are relevant and personalized to my current activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting context THEN the system SHALL analyze content from all relevant browser tabs
2. WHEN processing context THEN the system SHALL filter sensitive information automatically
3. WHEN storing context THEN the system SHALL use vector embeddings for semantic search
4. WHEN context changes THEN the system SHALL update understanding in real-time
5. IF privacy mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL not persist any context data

### Requirement 3: Privacy and Security Framework

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want AI processing to protect my sensitive information so that my personal data remains secure while still benefiting from AI assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing content THEN the system SHALL detect and filter PII automatically
2. WHEN sending data to external models THEN the system SHALL anonymize all personal information
3. WHEN storing AI data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all data at rest and in transit
4. WHEN users request data deletion THEN the system SHALL completely remove all associated data
5. IF sensitive content is detected THEN the system SHALL request explicit user permission before processing### Req
uirement 4: Response Processing and Caching

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast AI responses that don't repeat expensive computations so that I get quick answers while minimizing costs and resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing similar queries THEN the system SHALL use cached responses when appropriate
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL stream results for immediate user feedback
3. WHEN aggregating responses THEN the system SHALL combine multiple model outputs intelligently
4. WHEN responses are ready THEN the system SHALL deliver them within 3 seconds for 90% of queries
5. IF cache is stale THEN the system SHALL refresh it automatically based on content changes

### Requirement 5: Local AI Processing

**User Story:** As a user with privacy concerns, I want some AI processing to happen locally on my device so that sensitive information never leaves my computer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing sensitive content THEN the system SHALL use local models when possible
2. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL provide basic AI functionality using local processing
3. WHEN local resources are limited THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to essential features
4. WHEN local models are updated THEN the system SHALL download and install them automatically
5. IF local processing fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to cloud processing with user consent

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI features to be responsive and not slow down my browsing so that AI enhancement feels seamless and natural.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing AI requests THEN the system SHALL maintain browser responsiveness at all times
2. WHEN under heavy load THEN the system SHALL queue requests and process them efficiently
3. WHEN resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize user-facing operations
4. WHEN scaling up THEN the system SHALL handle increased load without degrading performance
5. IF system resources are low THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce AI processing intensity

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI features to handle errors gracefully so that temporary issues don't break my workflow or cause data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI models fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and alternative models
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL queue requests and process them when connectivity returns
3. WHEN errors happen THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages to users
4. WHEN recovery is possible THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt recovery without user intervention
5. IF persistent errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging and support

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I need visibility into AI system performance so that I can optimize operations and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI operations occur THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics and usage statistics
2. WHEN errors happen THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information and context
3. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL provide insights into bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
4. WHEN monitoring costs THEN the system SHALL track usage across all AI providers and features
5. IF anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and suggest corrective actions

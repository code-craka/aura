# Custom Command System - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Custom Command System empowers users to create personalized workflow automations by recording, customizing, and executing multi-step browser tasks through natural language commands. This system transforms repetitive manual processes into single-command executions, dramatically improving productivity and reducing cognitive load.

The system learns from user behavior patterns, suggests automation opportunities, and provides a flexible framework for creating both simple shortcuts and complex conditional workflows. It serves as the foundation for advanced productivity features and enables users to build their own intelligent browser assistants.

## Foundation Dependencies

This system builds upon the following foundational components:

- **Browser Core Foundation**: Provides browser action APIs, tab management, extension system, and security framework
- **AI Engine Foundation**: Supplies pattern recognition, natural language processing, and workflow optimization
- **UI Foundation**: Delivers command builder interfaces, workflow visualization, and execution feedback components

These foundations must be implemented before the Custom Command System can be developed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Workflow Recording and Capture

**User Story:** As a productivity user, I want to record my repetitive browser tasks so that I can automate them later without having to manually program each step.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates workflow recording THEN the system SHALL use Browser Core Foundation's action monitoring APIs to capture all browser actions including clicks, typing, navigation, and form interactions
2. WHEN recording a workflow THEN the system SHALL use Browser Core Foundation's DOM analysis and AI Engine Foundation's pattern recognition to identify actionable elements with robust selectors
3. WHEN user actions involve dynamic content THEN the system SHALL use AI Engine Foundation's context analysis to capture context and parameters for future adaptation
4. WHEN recording is complete THEN the system SHALL use AI Engine Foundation's natural language processing to generate human-readable workflow summaries with identified steps and parameters
5. IF recording captures sensitive information THEN the system SHALL use AI Engine Foundation's privacy framework to request permission and offer parameterization or exclusion of sensitive data

_Foundation Dependencies: Browser Core Foundation (Action Monitoring APIs, DOM Analysis), AI Engine Foundation (Pattern Recognition, Context Analysis, Natural Language Processing, Privacy Framework)_

1. WHEN defining parameters THEN the system SHALL support validation rules (required, format, range, custom validation)
2. WHEN executing commands THEN the system SHALL validate all parameters before beginning workflow execution
3. WHEN parameters have default values THEN the system SHALL use them when inputs are not provided
4. WHEN parameters depend on context THEN the system SHALL extract values from current browsing state (active tab, selected text, etc.)
5. IF parameter validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and correction suggestions

### Requirement 6: Command Organization and Management

**User Story:** As a user with many custom commands, I want to organize and manage my workflows so that I can find and maintain them efficiently.

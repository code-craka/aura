# Browser Core Foundation - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Browser Core Foundation provides the fundamental Chromium-based browser engine that serves as the platform for all Project Aura features. This foundation must deliver a robust, secure, and performant browsing experience while providing the necessary hooks and APIs for AI integration.

This system forms the bedrock upon which all AI features, custom UI components, and advanced functionality will be built. It must maintain compatibility with web standards while enabling the innovative AI-native features that differentiate Project Aura.

## Requirements

3. WHEN integrating AI features THEN the engine SHALL provide hooks for content extraction without breaking page functionality
4. WHEN users install extensions THEN the browser SHALL maintain compatibility with Chrome extension APIs
5. IF security vulnerabilities are discovered THEN the system SHALL support rapid Chromium security updates

### Requirement 2: Tab Management System

**User Story:** As a user, I want advanced tab management capabilities that go beyond traditional browsers so that I can organize my browsing more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening tabs THEN the system SHALL support unlimited tabs with efficient memory management
2. WHEN organizing tabs THEN users SHALL be able to create Spaces and Tab Groups with visual organization
3. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL provide instant switching with <100ms response time
4. WHEN tabs become inactive THEN the system SHALL automatically suspend them to conserve resources
5. IF tabs crash THEN the system SHALL isolate failures and allow recovery without affecting other tabs

### Requirement 3: Security and Privacy Framework

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want robust security and privacy protections built into the browser foundation so that my data and browsing are protected by default.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browsing websites THEN the system SHALL enforce strict security policies and sandboxing
2. WHEN storing user data THEN all sensitive information SHALL be encrypted at rest and in transit
3. WHEN communicating with external services THEN the system SHALL use certificate pinning and secure protocols
4. WHEN users enable privacy mode THEN the system SHALL prevent all data persistence and tracking
5. IF security threats are detected THEN the system SHALL block malicious content and warn users

### Requirement 4: Extension System Architecture

**User Story:** As a power user, I want to use existing Chrome extensions while having access to enhanced AI-powered extensions so that I can customize my browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing Chrome extensions THEN they SHALL work without modification in 95% of cases
2. WHEN extensions request permissions THEN the system SHALL provide granular control and clear explanations
3. WHEN AI features interact with extensions THEN they SHALL do so through secure, well-defined APIs
4. WHEN extensions conflict THEN the system SHALL provide resolution mechanisms and user control
5. IF extensions behave maliciously THEN the system SHALL detect and isolate them automatically

### Requirement 5: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a user with limited system resources, I want the browser to be efficient and responsive so that it doesn't slow down my computer or drain my battery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the browser is idle THEN it SHALL use <2% CPU and minimize memory footprint
2. WHEN loading pages THEN 90% of pages SHALL load in <2 seconds on standard connections
3. WHEN running multiple tabs THEN memory usage SHALL scale efficiently with tab count
4. WHEN on battery power THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize for power efficiency
5. IF system resources are low THEN the browser SHALL gracefully reduce functionality to maintain responsiveness

### Requirement 6: AI Integration Hooks

**User Story:** As an AI feature developer, I need standardized APIs to access browser content and state so that I can build AI features that integrate seamlessly with the browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI features need page content THEN the system SHALL provide sanitized DOM access APIs
2. WHEN extracting context THEN the system SHALL offer structured data extraction with privacy filtering
3. WHEN AI features need to perform actions THEN the system SHALL provide secure automation APIs
4. WHEN multiple AI features run THEN the system SHALL coordinate resource usage and prevent conflicts
5. IF AI features request sensitive data THEN the system SHALL enforce user consent and privacy controls

### Requirement 7: Cross-Platform Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user on different operating systems, I want consistent browser functionality across all my devices so that I can have the same experience everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Windows, macOS, or Linux THEN all core features SHALL work identically
2. WHEN using platform-specific features THEN the system SHALL integrate with OS capabilities appropriately
3. WHEN syncing data THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across different platforms
4. WHEN updating THEN the system SHALL support automatic updates on all supported platforms
5. IF platform differences exist THEN the system SHALL gracefully adapt while maintaining core functionality

### Requirement 8: Developer Tools and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I need comprehensive debugging and development tools so that I can build and troubleshoot AI features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging AI features THEN developers SHALL have access to enhanced DevTools with AI-specific panels
2. WHEN inspecting browser state THEN tools SHALL provide visibility into tab management and AI context
3. WHEN testing features THEN the system SHALL support automated testing frameworks and mocking
4. WHEN profiling performance THEN tools SHALL show detailed metrics for both browser and AI operations
5. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging and error reporting for debugging

### Requirement 9: Update and Maintenance System

**User Story:** As a user, I want automatic updates that keep my browser secure and up-to-date so that I always have the latest features and security patches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updates are available THEN the system SHALL download and install them automatically in the background
2. WHEN critical security updates are released THEN they SHALL be applied within 24 hours
3. WHEN updating THEN user data and settings SHALL be preserved and migrated automatically
4. WHEN rollbacks are needed THEN the system SHALL support safe rollback to previous versions
5. IF updates fail THEN the system SHALL provide recovery mechanisms and user notification

### Requirement 10: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As an advanced user, I want to customize browser behavior and settings so that I can optimize the experience for my specific needs and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring settings THEN users SHALL have access to both basic and advanced configuration options
2. WHEN customizing UI THEN the system SHALL support themes, layouts, and component positioning

# Research Synthesis Engine - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Research Synthesis Engine transforms fragmented web research into structured, actionable insights by automatically organizing, analyzing, and synthesizing information from multiple sources. This system serves as an intelligent research assistant that helps users conduct systematic research, identify patterns and relationships, and generate comprehensive research outputs with proper attribution and organization.

The system integrates with cross-tab intelligence to leverage browsing context, provides structured research methodologies, and supports various research workflows from academic papers to business analysis. It emphasizes accuracy, proper attribution, and user control over research processes and outputs.

## Foundation Dependencies

This system builds upon the following foundational components:

- **Browser Core Foundation**: Provides content extraction, bookmark management, and cross-tab communication
- **AI Engine Foundation**: Supplies content analysis, pattern recognition, synthesis algorithms, and fact-checking
- **UI Foundation**: Delivers research organization interfaces, visualization components, and export tools
- **Cross-Tab Intelligence**: Provides multi-source analysis and relationship detection between research materials

These foundations must be implemented before the Research Synthesis Engine can be developed.
